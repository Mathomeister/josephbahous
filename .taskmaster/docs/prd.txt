# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Professional Landing Page Update

**1. Overview**

This document outlines the requirements for updating the personal landing page for Joseph Bahous. The primary goal is to shift from a direct booking system (Calendly) to a more managed and personalized request-based system using a form. This change aims to better manage inbound requests, set clear expectations for visitors, and refine the site's messaging to target students and early-career professionals more effectively.

**2. Goals**

- To replace the direct "Book a Chat" functionality with a "Request a Chat" form.
- To update the website copy to reflect a warmer, more personalized tone that manages expectations gracefully.
- To ensure the new system filters for the target audience (students and young professionals) without appearing exclusive or unapproachable.
- To provide Joseph with the necessary information (via the form) to prioritize and respond to the most relevant requests.

**3. Key Features**

- **Feature 1: Request Form Integration**
  - **Description:** All "Book a Chat" buttons and links will be replaced with a "Request a Chat" button that links to an external form (Tally.so, Typeform, or Google Forms).
  - **User Story:** As a visitor, I want to fill out a simple form to request a chat so I can provide context about my inquiry.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - All instances of "Book a Chat" buttons are changed to "Request a Chat."
    - All button links are updated to the new form URL.
    - The FAQ section is updated to describe the new request process.

- **Feature 2: Updated Website Copy**
  - **Description:** The messaging in the "Let's Connect" contact section will be updated to be more personal and to set expectations about response availability.
  - **User Story:** As a visitor, I want to understand who Joseph typically connects with so I know if my request is a good fit.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - The text in the contact section is updated to: "I love connecting with students and early professionals. I review all requests personally and respond to as many as I can."

- **Feature 3: Form Creation**
  - **Description:** Create a new form with specific screening questions. This task will be handled by Joseph, who will provide the final URL. The form should include conditional logic.
  - **Form Questions:**
    1.  Name (Short answer)
    2.  Location (City & Country) (Short answer)
    3.  Which best describes you? (Multiple Choice: Student, Young Professional, Other)
    4.  (Conditional) Educational Background & Institution (Short answer)
    5.  (Conditional) Current Role/Industry & Years of Experience (Short answer)
