## 🌟 Project Overview

- **Type:** Static website (HTML, CSS, minimal JS)
- **Purpose:** Personal/professional profile, mentorship offering, and contact point
- **Design:** Clean, professional, responsive
- **Booking:** Calendly integration for scheduling chats

---

## 📝 Design Thinking & Wireframe Rationale

- **Goal:** Maximize conversion by making it easy for visitors to understand Joseph's value and book a chat.
- **Above the Fold:** Headline, subheadline, and a single prominent CTA ("Book a Chat") are placed at the top for immediate clarity and action.
- **Trust Signals:** Credentials, affiliations, and testimonials (if available) are displayed just below the hero section to build credibility.
- **Minimal Navigation:** Only essential links (Home, About, Book a Chat, Contact) to reduce distraction and keep focus on the CTA.
- **About & Contact:** Short bio and contact info are included for transparency and accessibility.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Headline and CTA are most prominent, followed by trust signals and supporting info.
- **Mobile-First:** Navigation collapses to a hamburger menu; sections stack vertically for readability and usability on small screens.
- **Accessibility & Performance:** Semantic HTML, high contrast, keyboard navigation, and optimized assets are prioritized.
