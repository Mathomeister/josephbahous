# Cursor Agent Communication Research Summary

## Research Overview
**Date**: January 27, 2025  
**Focus**: How to communicate with and switch between AI agents in Cursor, including model selection strategies

## Key Findings

### 1. Agent Definition (2025)
Based on current research, a Cursor AI agent is defined as:
- **Core Formula**: `LLM + Tools + Loop`
- **Components**: Instructions (system prompts) + Model + Tools
- **Capability**: Can iterate through multiple steps autonomously
- **Trust Level**: Upgraded from "advisor" to "agent" with greater autonomy

### 2. Model Switching Methods

#### Current Available Methods:
1. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: `Cmd + /` (Mac) or `Ctrl + /` (Windows)
2. **Chat Interface**: Click model name → Select from dropdown
3. **Agent Mode**: Background agents can auto-run commands
4. **Rule-Based**: `.mdc` files can specify model preferences

#### Model Cycling Order:
Claude 3.5 Sonnet → GPT-4o → Gemini 2.5 Flash → DeepSeek V3.1 → (repeat)

### 3. Agent Communication Patterns

#### Direct Invocation:
```
@[agent-name] [request]
@frontend-developer Create a navigation component
@qa-testing Write unit tests for authentication
```

#### Context-Based Activation:
- **File types**: `.tsx` → Frontend Agent
- **Directories**: `/tests` → QA Agent  
- **Keywords**: "deploy" → DevOps Agent

#### Rule-Based Switching:
- Uses `.mdc` rule files in `.cursor/rules/`
- Five rule levels: IDE-wide, Project, Always, Agent-requested, Auto-attached
- Rules cascade and combine for fine-tuned behavior

### 4. Cost Optimization Strategy

#### Research-Based Model Mapping:
```yaml
Free Models (80% usage):
  - Gemini 2.5 Flash: UI/UX, simple frontend
  - DeepSeek V3.1: Backend development, APIs
  - GPT-4o mini: Testing, documentation
  - Grok 3 Mini: Basic DevOps tasks

Premium Models (20% usage):
  - Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Complex problem solving
  - GPT-4o: Advanced planning, architecture
  - Gemini 2.5 Pro: Infrastructure, DevOps
```

#### Auto-Escalation Triggers:
- Error after 2 attempts with free model
- Complex architectural decisions
- Security-critical implementations
- Performance optimization needs

### 5. Advanced Features (2025)

#### Background Agents:
- Can execute tasks autonomously
- Useful for repetitive development tasks
- Automated testing, documentation generation
- Dependency updates

#### Memory System:
- Remembers project-specific information across sessions
- Stores information per project (privacy-focused)
- Improves context retention and consistency

#### MCP Integration:
- Model Context Protocol extends agent capabilities
- 250,000+ monthly active developers using MCP
- Acts as "USB protocol for AI" - standardized tool access

### 6. Current Limitations & Workarounds

#### Limitations:
- No native multi-agent support in Cursor
- Model selection not persistent per conversation
- Limited automatic model switching based on task complexity

#### Workarounds:
- Use specialized rule files for different agents
- Implement cost-optimization rules manually
- Use MCP servers for enhanced capabilities
- Create workflow-based agent switching patterns

### 7. Best Practices Identified

#### Communication:
- Be specific about agent role needed
- Provide clear context about current task
- Use actionable language
- Reference existing code/files when relevant

#### Model Selection:
- Start with free models (cost-effective)
- Escalate to premium models for complex problems
- Monitor usage patterns regularly
- Set clear boundaries for premium model usage

#### Agent Switching:
- Use explicit `@agent-name` invocation for clarity
- Leverage context-based activation for efficiency
- Implement workflow-based switching for complex features
- Document agent handoffs for team coordination

## Implementation in Bootstrap Repository

- MCP integration significantly enhances agent capabilities

## Conclusion

The research reveals that effective Cursor agent communication requires:
1. **Clear understanding** of agent specializations
2. **Strategic model selection** based on task complexity and cost
3. **Efficient switching patterns** using rules and context
4. **Cost optimization strategies** to maintain sustainable usage
5. **Advanced tool integration** through MCP for enhanced capabilities

Our bootstrap repository implements these findings into a production-ready system that maximizes productivity while minimizing costs.
