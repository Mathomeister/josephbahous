## Recommendations

- **Current (Development/Preview):**
  - GitHub Pages is ideal for static content, public .md files, and simple workflows.
  - Easy to set up, free, and integrates with your existing GitHub repo.

- **Production (Final Domain):**
  - If you need advanced features (serverless functions, analytics, instant rollbacks), consider Netlify or Vercel.
  - Both support custom domains, SSL, and easy migration from GitHub.
  - AWS S3 + CloudFront is best for enterprise needs but is more complex.

- **Publishing Markdown:**
  - GitHub is ideal for making .md files public (for AI/LLM access).
  - Netlify/Vercel can also serve .md files if included in the build output.

---

## Next Steps
- Continue using GitHub Pages for now.
- Revisit hosting when ready for production and after purchasing the final domain.
- Document DNS and deployment steps for a smooth migration if needed.

## Domain Name Options

### Recommended Registrars
- **Google Domains (Squarespace):** User-friendly, good DNS, privacy included
- **Namecheap:** Affordable, free WHOIS privacy, easy DNS
- **GoDaddy:** Large provider, frequent discounts, but upsells and privacy may cost extra
- **Hover:** Simple, privacy included, no upsells
- **Cloudflare Registrar:** At-cost pricing, excellent DNS, limited TLDs

### TLD Choices
- **.com:** Most trusted and credible
- **.org, .net:** Good alternatives
- **.io, .co, .ai:** Popular with tech/startup audiences
- **Country-specific (.ca, .us, etc.):** For regional targeting

### Key Considerations
- **Availability:** Use registrar search tools to check if your preferred name is available
- **Branding:** Short, memorable, easy to spell
- **Privacy:** Choose a registrar with free WHOIS privacy
- **DNS Management:** Good DNS tools make setup and changes easier
- **Email:** Some registrars offer bundled email, or use Google Workspace/Zoho

### Setup Steps
1. Brainstorm and check availability for preferred names (e.g., josephbahous.com)
2. Register the domain with privacy protection
3. Set up DNS to point to your chosen host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)
4. Configure SSL (most hosts provide this for free)
5. Document DNS and deployment steps for future reference

### Typical Cost
- .com: $10–$15/year
- .io, .ai: $30–$80/year
- Privacy should be free
